## Description of dataset
The total amount of the samples in TSCD dataset is 5140.  All the pathces were cropped in size of 256 * 256 pixels after registration. The specific area of TSCD dataset is located at Tianfu New Area Science City in the south of Chengdu, near the Xinglong Lake. During 2016 and 2022, this region has undergone a significant evolution of ground objects.
